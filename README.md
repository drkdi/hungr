# Hungr



Hungr is a food blogging site, inspired by Tumblr. Users can sign up, make different types of posts(text, image, media, etc), and have an index of all of their posts and of their followed users.
It was built using a Rails backend, and React / Redux frontend, with AWS to host different types of media.
